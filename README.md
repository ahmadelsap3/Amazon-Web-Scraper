- **amazon_egypt_mobile_phones.csv**: The resulting dataset containing mobile phone listings scraped from Amazon Egypt.

## Features
- Web scraping of Amazon Egypt mobile phone listings
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization for insights

## How to Use
1. Open the `Amazon_web_scarper.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run the cells to reproduce the scraping, cleaning, and analysis steps.
3. The CSV file can be used for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup4, matplotlib, seaborn (install via pip if needed)
